We have identified the following 2 requirements:

#. No Gaps in between Steps
#. User Inputs number of Steps

No Gaps in between Steps
----

In order to achieve an accurate **replication** of a staircase, the steps needed to be one next to the other. Due to the robot's end-effector size, the bricks would have never been able to be aligned one next to the other. Therefore, **avoiding gaps** between the steps was definitely a main objective.
    
User Inputs number of Steps
----

Another important feature to make the robot as autonomous as possible was leaving the **choice** of the number of steps to the user. The robot would have then had to adapt to the request of the user and plan his trajectory accordingly.
