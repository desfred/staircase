Testing the code on the real robot
====

Our development process was significantly slowed by technical problems due to Gazebo, and we haven't had a chance to try our code on the physical robot.  We predict a much higher success rate in real life, as most of the problems that make our staircase 'break' are due to the unrealistically low friction and weight of simulated bricks (see Gazebo Limitations page for details).

Improving the motion planning
====

Perfecting the interpolation of joint angles could reduce 'shakiness' in the robot's movement (see Motion Planning page for details).
